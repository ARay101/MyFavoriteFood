            <p id="sp">My favorite food is pizza. It's very delicious. My favorite kind of chicken pizza, with some vegetables and cheese, however, I don't care which sauce it is unless it's spicy. <br> Pizza is a very popular food, and there are many pizzerias worldwide, including Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Papa John's, Pizza Corner, and Smokin' Joe's.

        Modern-day pizza was made in Naples 200 to 300 years ago, as what is now known as Neapolitan pizza. It can be sold fresh or frozen, in a whole or in slices of a pizza. <br> In a pizza, there's the original flatbread-like design, on which there's sauce, cheese and toppings(that can include vegetables and meat). On the outside there is a hard layer known as the crust. The ending result is very delicious! There are several types of pizza, variations usually either change one or two things to the main process and/or change toppings.
